# Base Devcontainer Template

As someone who often forgets the exact steps to configure devcontainers, I created this template repository. It's my go-to starting point, saving me the hassle of remembering the specifics each time. Now, I can simply use this as a base for any new project and modify it to fit the project's needs.
